        <p>Hi, my name's Nick Laswell and I'm a junior CIT student at IUPUI with a concentration in Web & Software Development.
            <br>
            After finishing
                    my degree, I plan to find a career as a Software Developer. In my free time I like to watch movies and TV shows,
            <br>
            play video games, 
                    and design 3D models for game-making.
